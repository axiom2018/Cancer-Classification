# Cancer-Classification
A cancer detection system using the Wisconsin Beast Cancer Dataset.

Classification is one of my favorite machine learning problems. In
this project there are several tasks to get good results.

1) **Data Analysis**
Exploring the dataset using several functions like .head, .shape, .dtypes
and more. Plots are used as well.



2) **Feature Engineering**
Perhaps the most important step. Feature engineering does certain tasks with
the features to get the best out of the model(s) and increase performance.
Several methods are used in the feature_engineering.py class in an attempt
to get the best out of the models.



3) **Model Training**
More than 1 model is used because model results may vary. In the professional
world, surely developers don't just stick with one model. 



4) **Evaluate Models**
See how the models are doing by using confusion matrices, classification reports,
and getting the overall accuracy of each one. Also save the best model with a few
extra lines of code that will definitely be sure to get the one with the best
accuracy.
